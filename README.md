# Potato-Disease-classification-using-CNN
This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify potato diseases as either early blight or late blight.
The model was trained and tested on a dataset of potato disease images.
The model achieved an accuracy of 97.6% on the test set.
The project was hosted using streamlit for easy testing and demonstration.
